# mongo-technica
This app scrapes articles from Ars Technica, and allows users to comment on articles. On scraping, the articles are saved to a MongoDB database (modeled with Mongoose). The layout is Bootstrap 4 with a custom logo (a parody of the Audio-Technica logo...bit of a conceptual pun). Rounding out the backend is some Node.js/Express.js.
